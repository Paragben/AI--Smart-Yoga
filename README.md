# AI--Smart-Yoga
Corroboration of poses through a GUI using CNN and LSTM

The importance of yoga is renowned worldwide. Its health benefits, preached
by ancient sages, have stood the test of time.
Even though yoga is becoming preeminent, there are important challenges faced while doing yoga,
such as performing it with incorrect form, the classes being expensive and the
shortage of time in our busy lives.
It allows many users to practice in a zero-judgment environment, which can make a huge difference for many to
help gain their confidence.
Artificial intelligence and Machine learning techniques exhibit promising
solutions for human pose estimation. Our reagent will be trained with the
help of expert yoga gurus, and images of correct postures for every Asan
there are integrated into the app.

This reagent will check the userâ€™s technique to perform the asana through live
feed and in case the user is unable to perform or wrongly performing the
Asan the reagent will detect it and intimate the user with the right technique
to correct the pose with an image of it
